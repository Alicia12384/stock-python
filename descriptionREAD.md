-the code is supposed to make an INTERACTIVE chart using plotly and cufflinks - it plots 2 dataseries together

-Issues: the code works fine in jupyter notebook and produces the chart but does not when put into sublime and run on the command line
Problem with not having a plotly account for this? not sure
